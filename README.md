# AI6127-Deep-Neural-Network-for-Natural-Language-Processing

This repository contains source codes and reports for two individual assignments and one group project for the course AI6127. 
The first assignment involves a simple sentiment analysis using recurrent models. The second assignment involves a machine learning translation task, using seq2seq models.
For the final group project, groups are free to choose their topics and scopes; we decided to work on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection, which is an NER task.
